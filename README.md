#css.php

##Generate CSS style sheets with PHP.

PHP variables can be added to variables.php and referenced in the style.php.css "style sheet."
When css.php is executed from the command line, a normal CSS file, "style.css" will be generated.

Future additions will include another file called functions.php that will be used to store
"CSS functions," and a check in css.php to prevent inadvertently overwiting style.css if it has
been edited directly since it was last generated.
