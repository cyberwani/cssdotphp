#css.php

###Generate CSS style sheets with PHP.

Variables defined in variables.php can be referenced in the 
style.php.css "style sheet." When css.php is executed from the
command line, a normal CSS file, "style.css" will be generated.

Functions can also be used in varibles.php, but their output must
be stored in a variable inside style.php.css in order to be
evaluated.
